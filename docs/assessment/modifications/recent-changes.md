### What's Been Modified From the Original?

This appears to be the original repository, not a fork. Recent changes include:

1. **Potion Positioning Fix:** The mod now tells the extension exactly where potions are (position changes based on how many relics you have)

2. **Bottled Card Support:** Cards in bottles now show correctly with the bottle icon

3. **Special Card Handling:** Cards like Searing Blow and Genetic Algorithm show correct values based on upgrades

4. **Map View:** Added a full dungeon map viewer (press Map button to see your path)

5. **Combat Piles:** Can now see your draw, discard, and exhaust piles during combat

6. **Performance Improvements:** Moved from constant polling to event-based updates, uses less bandwidth

7. **Better Tooltips:** Split into frequent and rare updates to save bandwidth
