### How Does It Work?

**Three Parts Working Together:**

1. **The Mod (runs on your PC):**
   - Installed via Steam Workshop
   - Watches your game and captures what's happening
   - Sends updates to the cloud server
   - Has a config menu to set sync delay with your stream

2. **The Server (runs on baalorlord.tv):**
   - Receives updates from your mod
   - Keeps track of your current game state
   - Pushes updates to Twitch when things change
   - Makes sure viewers see the right info

3. **The Extension (runs in viewers' browsers):**
   - Shows the overlay on top of your stream
   - Gets updates from Twitch in real-time
   - Displays cards, relics, tooltips exactly where they are in-game
   - Viewers can click cards to zoom in and see details
