### What is Slay the Relics?

Slay the Relics is a Twitch extension that shows your Slay the Spire game info overlaid on your stream. When you're streaming the game, viewers can see:
- Your full deck with card art
- Your relics and potions with descriptions
- Your current combat piles (draw, discard, exhaust)
- The dungeon map and your path
- Powers, orbs, and other buffs/debuffs

It looks just like the in-game UI, perfectly positioned over the actual game.
