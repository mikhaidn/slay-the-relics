### Important Current Limitation

**The extension ONLY works if your game fills the entire stream canvas** (like you're playing fullscreen). If you play windowed or have other elements on screen, the overlay positions won't match the actual game.

This is because the extension assumes:
- Your stream is 1920x1080
- The game fills 100% of the stream
- Game elements are always in the exact same spot
